triton_playground.ipynb is intended to be the playground where I try different triton kernels.

The idea is to use this notebook as a one-stop shop for all the kernels I write and maintain individual python modules for each kernel eventually.

These kernels are outside of what is covered in [Triton-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles)
